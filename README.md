# materializeTryout

This is a project to try out the framework Materialize. I'm building a postcard review of my travels in 2015, but really I just want to utilize as many different features of Materialize as I can. I'm using the Weather Underground API to pull in weather data about the places I've visited. I will also add a map of the area.

##Technologies Used
- Materialize
- Weather Underground API
- Google Maps API
